# CDC Data Reconciliation Tool
Our tool compares data between the CDC database and databases from the 50 U.S. state health departments. The data from the states is regarded as “the source of truth”. If any data in the CDC database errs from the state databases in any way, it will be regarded as a discrepancy which may be remedied.
